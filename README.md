# IDS-to-detect-MITM-through-ARP-Poisoning

This is a simple IDS that can be used to detect Man-in-the-Middle attacks using ARP Poisoning. The IDS dispays a warning message when it detects an attack. The IDS can be further enhanced to repair the poisoned caches of other victims by sending a fake ARP packet with correct IP, MAC adresses.
